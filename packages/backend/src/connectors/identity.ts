 * endpoint). This reuses the canonical federated-media path
 * (`persistRemoteMediaForFederatedOwnerDetailed` →
 * `POST /assets/service/federation`): SSRF-safe download → streamed upload as a
 * public, CDN-reachable file owned by the resolved federated user — the SAME
 * service-token flow that already mirrors federated post media and the avatar
 * (downloaded server-side by oxy-api). It deliberately does NOT use the SDK's
 * `uploadProfileBanner`, which routes through the USER-authenticated
 * `POST /assets/upload` and is rejected `401 UNAUTHORIZED` on the service client,
 * so the banner was never stored.
 *
 * Best-effort: returns `{ ok: true }` when the banner was stored, otherwise
 * `{ ok: false, permanent }`. `permanent` distinguishes a transient failure
 * (bad service credential, upstream 5xx, upload rejection — worth retrying) from
 * a permanently-unavailable banner (dead/oversized/non-image — never retry), so
 * the backfill caller can decide whether to back off and retry. A non-http url is
 * `permanent: true` (it will never become valid). Transient failures are surfaced
 * at `warn`; permanent ones stay quiet, mirroring `materializeFederatedMedia`.
 *
 * Shared by the live actor-resolution path (`resolveOxyExternalUser`, which
 * ignores the result) and the one-shot `backfillFederatedBanners` script (which
 * inspects `permanent` to drive retry) so both go through ONE implementation.
