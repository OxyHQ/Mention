# Mention Display Format Update

## Change Summary
Updated the mention system so that the `@` symbol is only used in the composer to trigger mention selection. In displayed posts, mentions appear as just the full name (without @) but are still clickable.

## Before vs After

### Before
- **Composer**: Type `@joh` → shows picker → inserts `@John Doe`
- **Display**: Shows `@John Doe` (with @ symbol)
- **Result**: Looked like Twitter/X style mentions

### After  
- **Composer**: Type `@joh` → shows picker → inserts `@John Doe` (unchanged)
- **Display**: Shows `John Doe` (without @ symbol, but blue and clickable)
- **Result**: Instagram-style mentions - more natural text appearance

## Technical Implementation

### Storage (MongoDB)
```
"Hey [mention:user123], check this out!"
```
No change - still uses placeholder format.

### Backend Processing
```typescript
// Before: [mention:userId] → @displayName
"Hey [mention:user123]" → "Hey @John Doe"

// After: [mention:userId] → [@displayName](username)
"Hey [mention:user123]" → "Hey [@John Doe](johndoe)"
```

### Frontend Rendering
```typescript
// LinkifiedText parses: [@displayName](username)
// Displays: displayName (without @ and brackets)
// Action: Clickable, navigates to /@username

"Hey [@John Doe](johndoe)" 
  ↓
"Hey " + <Text style={{color: blue}} onPress={→/@johndoe}>John Doe</Text>
```

## Visual Example

### Composer Screen
```
User types: "Hey @joh"
            ↓
Picker shows: 
  ┌─────────────────┐
  │ 👤 John Doe     │
  │    @johndoe     │
  └─────────────────┘
            ↓
Text becomes: "Hey @John Doe" ← Still shows @ while typing
```

### Post Display
```
Backend text: "Hey [@John Doe](johndoe), check this!"
              ↓
Rendered as:  "Hey John Doe, check this!"
                   ^^^^^^^^^ 
                   Blue, clickable
                   No @ symbol
```

## Benefits

1. **Natural Appearance**: Mentions look like regular text, not synthetic @-tags
2. **Instagram-Style UX**: Matches popular social media behavior
3. **Clear Distinction**: @ is for composing, clean names are for reading
4. **Still Interactive**: Mentions remain fully clickable despite no @ symbol
5. **No Ambiguity**: The `[@Name](username)` format clearly marks mentions in the data

## Files Changed

### Backend
- `packages/backend/src/controllers/feed.controller.ts`
  - Updated `replaceMentionPlaceholders()` method
  - Now outputs: `[@displayName](username)` format

### Frontend  
- `packages/frontend/components/common/LinkifiedText.tsx`
  - Updated regex pattern to detect `[@Name](username)` format
  - Extracts and displays just the name part
  - Keeps username for navigation

### Documentation
- [MENTION_IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE.md](./MENTION_IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE.md)
  - Updated all examples and explanations
  - Clarified the three-stage format transformation

## Migration Notes

If you have existing posts with the old format:
- Old format: `@John Doe` (plain text with @)
- New format: `[@John Doe](johndoe)` (structured)
- Old mentions will still display but won't be clickable
- New posts automatically use the new format
- Optional: Run migration to convert old posts to new format

## Testing

To test the new format:
1. Compose a new post with mentions
2. Post it and view in feed
3. Verify mention displays without @ symbol
4. Verify mention is blue/purple colored
5. Tap mention and verify navigation to profile
6. Compare with Instagram mention behavior
